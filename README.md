## Background
With the evolution of the sport, players have greater access to training facilities and have been able to build stronger capabilities to improve their play.

This has made it increasingly difficult for managers to predict the outcomes for the teams that they draft. They are no longer able to predict their teamsâ€™ success based on traditional methods, such as their height, strength, shooting abilities etc. 

The most successful teams are no longer a combination of the best Point Guards, Shooting Guards, Small Forwards, Power Forwards and Centres. More unorthodox groups can achieve great success too.

## Problem Definition:
Hence, we ask:
- How might we provide more insightful recommendations on team composition to todays managers?

To address this question, we set out to uncover the kind of players that todays high-performing basketball teams are composed of, by using machine learning techniques to reveal the true meta of NBA

## Models Used

1. Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering 
2. K-Means Clustering
